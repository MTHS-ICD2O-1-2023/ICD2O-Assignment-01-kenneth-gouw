        <p class="description">Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, to parents Joanne Simpson and Abdulfattah Jandali. He was
        later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs with whom he moved to Mountain View, California. As a child, Jobs was interested in engineering and electronics and took apart various items to see how they worked. He
        later attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California.</p>

        <h3 class="year">1970-1972</h3>
        <p class="description">In the early part of 1970, Jobs’ meets the future Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, through a mutual friend and the two
        get along quite well despite their four-year age difference.
        In 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. However, he dropped out after one semester as he felt that
        he was not getting anything out of it. Although, Steve Jobs did continue auditing calligraphy classes at Reed College
        which kept him interested..</p>

        <h3 class="year">1976</h3>
        <p class="description">Wozniak had designed and built his own computer-cum-logic board which he called the Apple I. With Jobs’ help, they
        founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) in 1976 and released their first product, the Apple I, later that year.
        
        Apple’s third founder, Ronald Wayne, served as the group’s adult supervisor, drawing up the Apple logo, the partnership
        agreement, and the manual for Apple I. Afraid of the financial risks, Ronald Wayne gave up his shares for a sum of
        $2,300 but the Apple I went on to sell for $666.66 a piece by the end of the year.</p>

        <p class="description">On December 12, 1980, Apple went public and in just its initial public stock offering, managed to raise $110 million,
        more capital than any IPO since Ford in 1956! They made history that day, creating more millionaires than any other
        public offering had ever created before. This would be the start to a 2.75 trillion dollar company</p>
